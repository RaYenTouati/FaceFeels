# 🎭 FaceFeels – Emotion Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction

**FaceFeels** is a project that detects human emotions from facial images using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for feature extraction and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.  
The model is trained on a dataset with seven emotion categories: **angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised**.  

A **Flask web interface** allows users to drag and drop an image and instantly see the predicted emotion.

## Features

- Detects 7 basic emotions from facial images, providing the **probability percentage for each emotion**.
- Web interface for instant prediction.
- Uses classic machine learning methods: HOG + SVM.
- Provides probability scores for each emotion.

# 🎭 Emotion Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction

**FaceFeels** is a simple project for detecting emotions on human faces using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for feature extraction and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.  
The model is trained on a facial expression dataset containing seven emotion categories: **angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised**.  
A **Flask web interface** allows users to drag and drop an image and instantly see the predicted emotion.
